# Who's At The Office?

Geofencing app to know who's at the office. It uses requestLocationUpdates to check if the user is 50 meters around the office, and send changes back to the server. If changes occured, a push notification is sent through Google Cloud Messaging servers back to the app informing all the users of the change.

The server files are in the server folder in the root of this repo.
